# Warhundred Frontend Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of actionable improvement tasks for the Warhundred frontend project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## User Interface and Features
1. [x] Implement a login and registration form
2. [x] Implement a game lobby page
3. [] Create some pixi js canvas with a town for a lobby page (TownCanvas)
4. [] Implement a game chat 
5. [] Implement a user profile mini-page on a game lobby page (under the game chat)

## Authentication & Security

1. [ ] Enable authentication in the RequireAuth component (uncomment the conditional rendering)
2. [ ] Implement a token refresh mechanism in AuthProvider to handle token expiration
3. [ ] Add proper error handling for authentication failures
4. [ ] Implement secure storage for authentication tokens (consider using HttpOnly cookies instead of localStorage)
5. [ ] Add CSRF protection for API requests
6. [ ] Implement rate limiting for login attempts

## Code Architecture

7. [x] Create a common base component for canvas rendering to reduce duplication between TownCanvas and BattleCanvas
8. [x] Extract API calls from AuthProvider into a separate API service module
9. [x] Implement a state management solution (Redux, Zustand, or Context API) for global game state
10. [x] Create a routing configuration file to centralize route definitions
11. [x] Implement error boundary components to gracefully handle runtime errors
12. [x] Create a design system with reusable UI components

## Testing

13. [ ] Increase test coverage by adding tests for all utility functions
14. [ ] Add tests for React components using React Testing Library
15. [ ] Implement integration tests for critical user flows (login, registration, game interactions)
16. [ ] Add end-to-end tests using Cypress or Playwright
17. [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
18. [ ] Implement snapshot testing for UI components

## Performance

19. [ ] Optimize PixiJS rendering with proper asset management
20. [ ] Implement code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
21. [ ] Add lazy loading for non-critical components
22. [ ] Optimize CSS with proper scoping and minimize global styles
23. [ ] Implement memoization for expensive calculations
24. [ ] Add performance monitoring and analytics

## User Experience

25. [ ] Implement loading indicators for asynchronous operations
26. [ ] Add proper form validation with error messages
27. [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices
28. [ ] Add keyboard navigation and accessibility features
29. [ ] Implement game state transitions with animations
30. [ ] Add sound effects and background music

## Game Features

31. [ ] Implement mechanism to switch between game states (TOWN and BATTLE)
32. [ ] Add player character rendering and movement in town
33. [ ] Implement NPC characters and interactions
34. [ ] Create battle mechanics and UI
35. [ ] Add inventory and item management system
36. [ ] Implement quest system

## DevOps & Tooling

37. [ ] Set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions or similar
38. [ ] Implement automated deployment pipeline
39. [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting
40. [ ] Configure proper environment variable management for different environments
41. [ ] Set up logging and error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
42. [ ] Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of new features

## Documentation

43. [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all functions and components
44. [ ] Create component documentation with Storybook
45. [ ] Document API interfaces and data models
46. [ ] Create user documentation and tutorials
47. [ ] Add inline code comments for complex logic
48. [ ] Create architecture diagrams and documentation

## Code Quality

49. [ ] Enforce consistent code style with ESLint and Prettier
50. [ ] Refactor complex components into smaller, more focused components
51. [ ] Remove unused code and dependencies
52. [ ] Fix all ESLint warnings and errors
